# Excel Challenge: Kickstart My Chart

## Background

For this challenge, I will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

Over $2 billion has been raised using the crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
